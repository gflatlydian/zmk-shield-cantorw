## A ZMK shield to use the Cantor Keyboard wirelessly with PillBug controllers

This is my first attempt at writing a ZMK shield. It seems to be working for me but no promises that it's in any way perfect.

As well as setting up the usual keyboard layout (with symbol, media key and bluetooth layers), I've also implemented:
* ZMK soft-off using the &softoff behaviour
* ZMK Studio to manipulate the layout

Feel free to fork the repo and use for your own purposes (such as by changing the layouts to your taste).
